          <p>
            BiteBuddy is a cutting-edge platform designed to connect customers
            with a wide range of restaurants, making it easier than ever to
            explore, book, and manage table reservations online. Unlike a single
            restaurant, BiteBuddy is a hub where multiple restaurants can
            register, allowing customers to browse menus, book tables, and
            rebook previous reservations all in one place.
